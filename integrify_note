line-height: 1.5;

today 08/08/2018
slectors tags
pseudo class we have discussed  also:
block, inline-block and positioning

we learn how to use boiler plate in VS code
script tag you can include JS BUT  for now we can skip it,
use of <div> elements--as block elements
explantion of div elements in details
border,height,width
background: color url('sss') diff btn background-color: blue;
diff btwn inline---u cant change the width and the height
inlineblock is opposite to inline
display: inline-block;

*The importanceof inline,inline-block etc

we talk about Position
by default is static....
there is relative(almost static like a boat in the sea),absolute(piled together),sticky etc
 we learn how to use BOX SIZING:---NEW Feature to adjust width and lenghth of HTML elements
remember to add box-sizing: border box so u dont need to calculate margins etc

Pseudo classes*
pseudo selectors e.g a:link, li a:hover

CSS combinators
like paragraphs inside the divs

FLEX-BOX 13.08.2018
you need a flexcontainer, and flex items
horizontal- main axis
vertical axis

notes
/*@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
                                                              body {
                                                                     background: green;
                                                               }

FORMS IN HTML
1)attributes
target = _blank-----it open a new tab           label,input,id,label
<form actions="/users.htmls"
form can take actions, methods="POST",
sometimes we need in form input
<form>
<label for..e.g firstname:>
<input id="firsname"type="text" placeholder="firstname"
<form>

21/08/2018

today discussion is based more on REGEX APART from what we discussed yesterday
continuation of form with html
regular expression not only for validations but also for something more
e.g
var pattern = "abc";
regular expression--how to search a word or words from a string
a* a exist once or many times
a+atleast once
[] this single
[abc] one of those
a.c means character a follwed by any character and follwed by c
required key word is important...it checks for valid and invalidity of input classes
placeholder:
input:valid::placeholder



22/08/2018(WEDNESDAY) NOTES:

We have a lecture on Git and GithubGIT- VERSION cONTROL(to control versions)
tokeep track on the version of your files

for collaboration

we learnt more abt other different versions control e.g bitbucket, subversion,Gitlab and github
we also checkedd different basic command lines e.g
for windows users and linux, mac users
windows...Dir display , mkdir, touch etc
ls-to see what is in directory, (mkdir-making directory- github-demo),cd-change directory, ls -a or ls -al(showing all hidden files and directory)
how to make multiple folders by mkdir -- --- ---
how to copy files using cp command
how to rename file by using mv command
how to remove files using rm command
rm* remove all files
rmdir remove directory
------------------------------------------

*How to sign-upin Github for new users
how to create a repo
then
git init command is  for initializing
.git is a hidden folder
git status is just to see whats happening or the status of your files
git add<file>
git diff -to see thr diff btw the files
git remote add origin master
git push -u origin master
git log-to see history of commits
git add . (to add multiple files)
git branch responsive----this is how to make a branch
git checkout responsive--to switch from a branch to branch, in this case to branch responsive
git checkout -b responvive.v2----another way to create a branch
git checkout master---switch to master branch
git pull---pulls from the remote back to a given branch
git merge---you can merge a branch to master

NOTES ABOUT PRESENTATION
what is a programminglanguage:
Coded language used by programmers to write instructions that a computer can understand to do what the programmer (or the computer user) wants.

Read more: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/programming-language.html

what is a variable:

what is an array:
IS A DATA STRUCTURE
Array data structure. ... In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.
ARRAY ARE USED IN A COMPUTER TO ORGANISE DATA, 

DESCRIPTION:
in a computer or any programming language we must have a way to store data, one of the common way to store data is by using arrays.
once you store data in an array the data in array they become elements of that particular array, you can store elements of different data types in an aray including numbers, strings even booleans(true or false)
we access arrays by using indeces, in any array index 0 means the first element and so on and on.
arrays are useful when u have a big collection of data.
arrays have different methods where you can manipulate elements in array e.g array.length or size etc
you can also loop an array and do whatever you wanna do with elements in an array.

JAVASCRIPT OUTPUT:
1)window.alert()- it allows you to display information via popup on the webpage.
2)document.write(); - Allows you to display info directly to the body of the webpage.Using this method will override any existing page content with the info you provide.
3) innerHTML
Averycommon way of outputting info to a webpage using Js is tomodify the content of elements on the page. e.g getElementById("id").InnerHTML

4) console.log --another way of outputting info using Js which doesnt involvemodifying the webpage.
using the console.log() method you can output info to the Js browser console.
mostlu used by developers for debugging

note: the console is the tool we will focus on, it allows you to write and execute Js code right away.


REGULAR EXPRESSION 04/10/2018
1)PATTERN building validation
2)
let regex /pattern/i-case sensitive,g-global, m for multiline
if you use case insesitive then u dont needa-z [A-Z]  :)
*DONT USE i really..not so practical, only important g and i 
/[abc]/ looking for  a or b or c
// we look for that string passed in those slash

/[0-9a-zA-Z]/  USE \d = 0-9,  \w = a-z (word character)
/\D/ non-DIGITS
/w/ NON-WORD CHARACTER

/[A-Za-z]{3}/ allow only 3 characters
/[A-Za-z]{3,5}$ ----we need 3 to 5 characters

^ ---a place to start....negate
$ once you find it stop

disable..true or false..we use that for submit button
. means any character
* 0 times or more times
?  zero or 1

const inputs = querlyselectorAll("input") for 4 inputs
inputs.addEventlistern("input", () => {
})

inputs.forEach(element => {
elemnts.addEventlistener("input", (e) => {
alert(e.target.ATTRIBUTE.name)
or clg(e.target.name) or use (attribue.name)
formValidator(e.target.value, pattern[e.target.name])
})
});

const patterns = {
firstNmae: /[^a-zA-Z]{3,5}$/,
lastName: /[^a-zA-Z]{3,5}$/,
email://
}

const formalValidoator = (element,pattern) => {
 if(pattern.test(element.value){
element.style.border...
element.className = "valid"
button.className = "submit-Button";
button.disabled = false;

}else

}

.submitt-button{
bg:green
}
